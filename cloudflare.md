# Open Links In a New Tab
This app considers all the visible anchors. 

When the user clicks on an anchor, the user can choose to open the linked document in a new tab or to open the document in the current tab. A bar appears at the top of the page and allows the user to choose. The user's choice for a specific anchor is saved for the whole browser session. 

If the anchor's 'target' attribute is equal to '_blank' , the linked document will always open in a new tab.
